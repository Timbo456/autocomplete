1. Hours to complete the project: This took at least 25 hours. 

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Brute-force Implementation): Used the slides from class as
				much as possible. This was difficult, but not as bad as part 
				two. The nearest neighbor took a while to figure out. 

   Problem 2 (2d-tree Implementation): This was challenging. I had a lot of 
				trouble with the puts and gets, as well as nearest. Got hung up
				on a loop, because my MaxPQ was out of order. Fortunatly it 
				printed output for different sections or I wouldn't have been
				able to troubleshoot. Very hard. 

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
